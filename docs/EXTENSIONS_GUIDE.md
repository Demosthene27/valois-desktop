# Lisk Hub Extension Guideline
``` ⚠️ Extension System is not avaliable on Production build so please use 'npm run dev' command ⚠️```

## How to create a new extension?
In your extension, you will have access to `React` and `LiskHubExtensions` that allows adding Your extension to specified areas in our code.

For building Your Component, You can use es6 and our wrapper will transpaile it for You.

| --------------- |---------------------------------------------|
| `addModule({ identifier, component })` | identifier: `String`, component: `Component` <br/> Adds new component to the place we specify               |
| `components`            | Contains shared styled components that We use in our app.             |

#### Props
Data from our store is accessible via `this.props.data` and actions to modify our store are in `this.props.actions`. Keep in mind that We are not sharing all data and actions. In case You want to access sth that is unavailable let us know by creating a feature proposal/ticket in our repo.
```
data = {
  latestBlocks,
  transactions,
  time,
  accountAddress,
  search,
}
actions={
  loadTransactions,
  sent,
  loadSingleTransaction,
  loadTransactions,
  searchDelegate,
  searchVotes,
  searchAccount,
  searchTransactions,
}
```

#### How to Share Your extension with others?
Once Your component was created You need to add it our [repository](https://github.com/michaeltomasik/extensions-lisk). In order to do it 
1. Create your own fork or branch.
2. Add your component.
3. Create Pull Request.

First We need to verify Your code and then We will merge Your extension.

In the future we will aim to create extension manager so users can easily add extension they want to their app.
