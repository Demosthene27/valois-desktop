# Lisk Hub Extension Guideline

## How to create a new extension?
In your extension, you will have access to `React` and `LiskHubExtensions` that allows adding Your extension to specified areas in our code.

For building Your Component, You can use ES6, and babel plugin in our app will handle everything else for You.

#### LiskHubExtensions
| Properties          |                    Description                 |
| --------------- |---------------------------------------------|
| `addModule({ identifier, component })` | identifier: `String`, component: `Component` <br/> Adds new component to the place we specify               |
| `components`            | Contains shared styled components that We use in our app.             |
| `identifiers`            | Identifier you pass to addModule() `dashboardColumn1, dashboardColumn2, dashboardColumn3`. It will add your component below dashboard components in specific column          |
